### GenAI

The GenAI surprised us last year!

+ How quickly we can accept these possibilities, so in fact they bring true value, not just interesting PoC and experiments?
+ What can help us today?
+ What tool are available?

### Service-based perspective 

We need more tools, you can call them:
+ Service-based component management tools
+ Network of Source-code management system 

Such component management tools are more important than the knowledge of hypermodularity.
Here is a tool which bring us the power of serving open and hypermodular architecture


## Autonomous Services Framework

ModuleTool is supporting creating and managing autonomous or automated services in a system architecture with a focus on modularity, scalability, and self-management. 

The concept of autonomous services is associated with microservices architectures where different services operate independently and possibly with autonomous decision-making abilities. In such architectures, services communicate with each other through well-defined interfaces, and each service is responsible for a specific piece of functionality within the larger application.

## Features of framework

1. **Service Discovery**: Mechanisms for services to dynamically discover and interact with each other in a constantly changing environment.
2. **Load Balancing**: Distributing requests among multiple service instances to optimize resource usage and response times.
3. **Fault Tolerance**: Providing robustness against failures, with patterns like retries, circuit breakers, and fallbacks.
4. **Scaling**: The ability to automatically adjust the number of service instances based on the demand.
5. **Monitoring and Logging**: Tools to track the performance and health of services, and to diagnose issues when they arise.
6. **Continuous Delivery/Deployment**: Support for deploying updates to services with minimal downtime, often through automated pipelines.

## Another tools

Examples of tools and platforms that offer similar functionality to what you might expect in an Autonomous Services Framework include:

- **Kubernetes**: An open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers.
- **Docker Swarm**: A container orchestrator provided by Docker, Inc. that helps manage a cluster of Docker Engines.
- **Apache Mesos**: A cluster manager that provides efficient resource isolation and sharing across distributed applications or frameworks.
- **Netflix OSS**: A set of frameworks and tools for building microservices, which includes Eureka for service discovery, Hystrix for fault tolerance, and Ribbon for load balancing, among others.
- **Istio**: An open platform to connect, manage, and secure microservices, which provides an easy way to create a network of deployed services with load balancing, service-to-service authentication, and monitoring.






### Service-based component management tools

The tool is about network of code (Service-based components), based on git versioned code will help to manage the level of **resuabuility**, which is depended by:
+ class
+ file
+ protocol
+ Hardware virutalization
+ Network Topology 
  
The **network of code** need the service-based component management tools which will provide the ability to view, install and register components according to a model-based approach. 
Moreover, in practice, reuse is not a binary concept: there is a need to control and administer levels of reuse. 

Creating a service-based component management tool that integrates with versioned code repositories, such as those managed by Git, and aids in measuring code reusability across various levels, such as class, file, protocol, hardware virtualization, and network topology, would require some sophisticated features. Here is an outline of a solution approach that might help in building such a tool:

1. **Version Control Integration**: The tool would need to integrate seamlessly with Git or other version control systems to track changes in code and components over time.

2. **Reusability Metrics and Analysis**: It should be able to analyze code to determine the reusability of various components. It could use metrics like the number of times a class or function is reused, the coupling between components, and other established software engineering metrics.

3. **Dependency Mapping**: The solution would employ dependency mapping and visualization to understand the relationship between different components and services. This could extend to understanding the implications on network topology as well.

4. **Code Scanning and Cataloging**: Automated scanning and cataloging of the repository to identify reusable code components. Each class, file, and protocol could be tagged with metadata to facilitate searching and filtering based on reusability factors.

5. **Hardware Virtualization and Network Topology Tools**: Integration with tools and platforms that manage hardware virtualization and network topology, like VMware, OpenStack, or Cisco’s network management tools, could provide insights into how reusability is affected by hardware or network changes.

6. **Documentation and Reporting**: The tool should generate documentation and reports that provide developers and teams with insights into the levels of reusability within their projects.

7. **Governance and Compliance**: Ensure that the management tool supports compliance with industry standards and best practices for code reusability and maintainability.

8. **User Interface (UI)**: A user-friendly UI that allows developers and managers to interact with the management tool effectively, providing quick access to various metrics and analyses, and a clear visualization of component relationships and network dependencies.

9. **APIs and Extensibility**: An API layer that allows for the tool’s integration with other systems and extensibility so that it can accommodate future requirements, such as new metrics for reusability or changing standards for service-based architecture.

10. **Collaboration and Workflow Support**: Features that facilitate communication and collaboration within development teams, with built-in workflows that support code review, component sharing, and reuse.

11. **Automation and CI/CD Integration**: To fit into modern DevOps practices, the tool should integrate with existing continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines, automating the assessment of reusability as part of the CI/CD process.

By focusing on these key aspects, a service-based component management tool can provide a comprehensive overview and management of a codebase’s reusability at various abstraction levels, from individual classes to entire service components operating within a hardware and network infrastructure context.




### Git is about versioning code

The [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) versioning system works at the code level and extends the capabilities of the modular network of code.
The distributed **version control system** that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers who are collaboratively developing source code during software development. 
I'ts goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different computers).
